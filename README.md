## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Axios API, version 1.6.2
- [Vue.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/) - JS framework, version 3.2.13



### What I learned

This clock app was a great oppurtunity to practise API calls, since I needed to use three different ones for the project. This was my first time fetching APIs with Axios. 

I also learned how to use async-await functions. I needed these in order for the website to first call the API, get the current time, and then let a function run which decides whether it is morning or evening, and show the appropriate background picture with the right way of greeting. 


### Continued development

Later I plan to add a function that refreshes the time every minute, so the application remains accurate.
I also plan to adjust the tablet and mobile views until they are perfect.
